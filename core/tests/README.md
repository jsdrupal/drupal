# Running tests

## Functional tests

* Start PhantomJS:
  ```
  phantomjs --ssl-protocol=any --ignore-ssl-errors=true ./vendor/jcalderonzumba/gastonjs/src/Client/main.js 8510 1024 768 2>&1 >> /dev/null &
  ```
* Run the functional tests:
  ```
  export SIMPLETEST_DB='mysql://root@localhost/dev_d8'
  export SIMPLETEST_BASE_URL='http://d8.dev'
  ./vendor/bin/phpunit -c core --testsuite functional
  ./vendor/bin/phpunit -c core --testsuite functional-javascript
  ```

Note: functional tests have to be invoked with a user in the same group as the
web server user. You can either configure Apache (or nginx) to run as your own
system user or run tests as a privileged user instead.

To develop locally, a straightforward - but also less secure - approach is to
run tests as your own system user. To achieve that, change the default Apache
user to run as your system user. Typically, you'd need to modify
`/etc/apache2/envvars` on Linux or `/etc/apache2/httpd.conf` on Mac.

Example for Linux:

```
export APACHE_RUN_USER=<your-user>
export APACHE_RUN_GROUP=<your-group>
```

Example for Mac:

```
User <your-user>
Group <your-group>
```

If the default user is e.g. `www-data`, the above functional tests will have to
be invoked with sudo instead:

```
export SIMPLETEST_DB='mysql://root@localhost/dev_d8'
export SIMPLETEST_BASE_URL='http://d8.dev'
sudo -u www-data -E ./vendor/bin/phpunit -c core --testsuite functional
sudo -u www-data -E ./vendor/bin/phpunit -c core --testsuite functional-javascript
```

## Nightwatch tests

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install). The versions required are specificed inside core/package.json in the `engines` field
- Install [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html)
- Inside the `core` folder, run `yarn install`
- Configure the nightwatch settings by copying `nightwatch.settings.json.default` to `nightwatch.settings.json`
- Again inside the `core` folder, run `yarn test:js` to run the tests. By default this will output reports to `core/reports`

Some settings can be overridden with environment variables:

| Variable   | Default Value | Description |
|------------|---------------|-------------|
| `HEADLESS_CHROME_DISABLED` |  `false` | If set to `true`, this will remove the `--headless` option passed to Chrome, allowing you to see tests running in realtime in the browser |
| `NIGHTWATCH_OUTPUT` | `reports/nightwatch` | This will output the test results into `core/reports/nightwatch`. Passing a value here is relative to the `core` directory |
| `NODE_ENV` | none | Setting this to `testbot` will cause Nightwatch to run with settings specific to the Drupal.org testbot |
| `BASE_URL` | none | Set this to the base URL for your Drupal install. Do not include the trailing slash. |
